            <p>Cascading Stylesheets — or CSS — is the first technology you should start learning after HTML. While HTML
                is used to define the structure and semantics of your content, CSS is used to style it and lay it out.
                For example, you can use CSS to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into
                multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.</p>
            <p>CSS is important, because without it, your page will have structure, but no style. This will make your
                website boring, which you don't want. You will most likely see CSS code that looks something similar to
                this:</p>

            <code>
                    body {
                        font-family: 'Poppins' ,Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
                        margin: 0;
                        padding: 0;
                        font-size: 100%;
                    }
                </code>

            <p>If you know literally nothing about CSS, there are resources out there, like websites and online courses.
                There are learning platforms like <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/"
                    target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/"
                    target="_blank">CodeAcademy</a>, <a href="https://www.codeconquest.com/" target="_blank">and
                    CodeConquest</a>, and more. And in this
                website we'll be talking about CSS to get you started on the right path in your coding journey.

            <p>You should learn the basics of HTML before attempting any CSS. We recommend that you work through our
                Introduction to HTML module first.</p>
            <p>Once you understand the fundamentals of HTML, we recommend that you learn further HTML and CSS at the
                same time, moving back and forth between the two topics. This is because HTML is far more interesting
                and much more fun to learn when you apply CSS, and you can't really learn CSS without knowing HTML.</p>
            <p>Before starting this topic, you should also be familiar with using computers and using the web passively
                (i.e., just looking at it, consuming the content). You should have a basic work environment set up as
                detailed in Installing basic software and understand how to create and manage files, as detailed in
                Dealing with files — both of which are parts of our Getting started with the web complete beginner's
                module.</p>
            <p>It is also recommended that you work through Getting started with the web before proceeding with this
                topic, especially if you are completely new to web development. However, much of what is covered in its
                CSS basics article is also covered in our CSS first steps module, albeit in a lot more detail.</p>

            <p>This topic contains the following modules, in a suggested order for working through them. You should
                definitely start with the first one.</p>
            <ul>
                <h3>
                    <li>CSS first steps</li>
                </h3>
                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages — for example, to alter the font,
                    color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and
                    other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery
                    with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add
                    styling to HTML. You'll probably learn basic code like this:</p>
                <code>
                        body {
                            text-size: 10px;
                            font-family: sans-serif;
                            color: black;
                        }
                    </code>

                <h3>
                    <li>CSS building blocks</li>
                </h3>
                <p>This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've gained familiarity with the
                    language and its syntax, and got some basic experience with using it, its time to dive a bit deeper.
                    This module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we have available, units,
                    sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more.
                </p>
                <p>The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all
                    the essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like text styling and CSS
                    layout. You'll probably be learning to code something like this:</p>
                <code>
                        body {
                            border: 5px;
                            border-style: solid;
                            border-radius: 10px;
                            border-color: blue;
                          }
                    </code>

                <h3>
                    <li>Styling text</li>
                </h3>
                <p>With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is styling
                    text — one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals,
                    including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows and other text
                    features. We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling
                    lists and links. An example of an ordered list in code is this:</p>
                <code>
                        li {
                            text-align: left;
                            color: black;
                            font-style: italic;
                        }
                    </code>

                <p>That would look something like this: </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Hello world!</li>
                    </ol>

                <h3>
                    <li>CSS layout</li>
                </h3>
                <p>At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and
                    manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes
                    in the right place in relation to the viewport, and one another. We have covered the necessary
                    prerequisites so we can now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings, modern
                    layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning, and some of the legacy techniques you might
                    still want to know about. You'll probably be learning to code something like this:</p>

                <code>
                        code {
                            display: block;
                            text-align: left;
                            white-space: pre-line;
                            position: relative;
                            word-break: normal;
                            word-wrap: normal;
                            line-height: 2;
                            background-color: #f7f7f7;
                            padding: 15px;
                            margin: 10px;
                            border-radius: 5px;
                          }
                    </code>
            </ul>

            <p>Use CSS to solve common problems provides links to sections of content explaining how to use CSS to solve
                very common problems when creating a web page.</p>
            <p>From the beginning, you'll primarily apply colors to HTML elements and their backgrounds; change the
                size, shape, and position of elements; and add and define borders on elements. But there's not much you
                can't do once you have a solid understanding of even the basics of CSS. One of the best things about
                learning CSS is that once you know the fundamentals, usually you have a pretty good feel for what can
                and can't be done, even if you don't actually know how to do it yet!</p>
